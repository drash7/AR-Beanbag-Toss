## Decription

This application is an augmented reality rendition of the popular cornhole/beanbag toss game, for Android phones with ARCore compatibility (this list can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)). The application will detect planes using the camera, on which a cornhole board can be placed. A beanbag can be thrown on the board using the Throw button on the UI; the board can be re-anchored and the game reset using the Anchor and Reset buttons, respectively. A score field at the top of the UI is updated after every valid throw, with +1 points for every throw on the board, and +3 for every throw into the hole. The throw location can be changed by moving around with the phone.
